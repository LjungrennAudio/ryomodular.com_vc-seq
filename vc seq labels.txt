Â 
Clock sync above audio rates. Overall latency approx 5us (0.005ms) to approx 10us (0.01ms) depending on output voltage change.

CV mode reaches thru the whole audio range extending the VC Sequencers funtionality into also being a 3 bit hands on waveshaper.

- In FWD/REV modes the CV/Clock input use a schmitt trigger with a window of 0.2V; the same window applies to the Reset input.
- In CV mode the CV/Clock input uses a set of 7 schmitt triggers, each step being separated by aapprox 0.625V.
